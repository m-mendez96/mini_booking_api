- Dockerized environment

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the project
  ```
    git clone https://github.com/m-mendez96/mini_booking_api.git
    cd mini_booking_api
  ```

### 2. Create the .env file

- Copy the example file and customize as needed: `cp .env.example .env`
- Update the environment variables (especially SECRET_KEY, DB credentials, etc.).

### 3. Build and start the containers
  ```
    docker compose up --build
  ```
  Let the containers initialize.

### 4. Run migrations
  In a separate terminal, apply migrations:
  ```
    docker compose exec api python manage.py migrate
  ```

### 5. Create superuser
  Still in the terminal:
  ```
    docker compose exec api python manage.py createsuperuser
  ```
  Enter your desired username, email, and password when prompted.
  Important: Remember these credentials â€” you'll use them to log into the admin and API.

## Verify the api is working

- Admin panel:
  ```
    http://localhost:8000/admin
  ```
  Use the credentials you set during createsuperuser.

- Swagger API docs:
  ```
    http://localhost:8000/api/docs/
  ```
  Explore and test the API directly from the browser.
